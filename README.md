# Bet022 - Event Prediction Platform

## Greetings traveler! 👋

My friends and I are fans of all sports events; we like to predict the outcome of those events and to compete with each other to see who was more successful at it. This application is made for that purpose, to ease our life, to grant us good competing user experience while we enjoy sports and great company.

In order to run the application first install the dependencies.

```bash
npm i
```

Then run a server with mock data:

```bash
npm run server
```

And run the application in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Cheers! 🍻
